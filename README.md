OG Project - https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap

This is a fork of input-leap with the aim of improving the interface on macOS a little bit. For example the menubar displaying two menu items called "Input-leap" has always annoyed me. 

I need to learn how to contribute to open source projects though so this is my test ground. I dont recommend anyone downloads this fork.
